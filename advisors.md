#### **Major Influences**

[Han Seunghoon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/louie-han-299584136) (HMGICS) taught me many things about translational RnD strategy and management.

My primary advisor during PhD is [Kevin Duh](http://cs.jhu.edu/~kevinduh/). I'm also very lucky to work with [Kokil Jaidka](https://kokiljaidka.wordpress.com/about/) (National University of Singapore), Lambert Mathias (Facebook AI Integrity), and [Jason Eisner](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason) (JHU).

[Chieu Hai Leong](https://chaileon.github.io) (DSO National Labs), [Steve Renals](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/srenals/) (University of Edinburgh) and briefly [Jiang Jing](http://w.mysmu.edu/faculty/jingjiang/) taught me things before grad school. 

In my previous life I learnt some Human Factors and Social psychology from [Angela Tan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/angela-tan-aa67487/) and [Bernice Khoo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernicekhoo/?originalSubdomain=sg). 

I owe much to [Dr. How Khee Yin](https://sg.linkedin.com/in/khee-yin-how-28367319), [Chua Kuan Seah](https://sg.linkedin.com/in/kuanseah), [Sng Mui Tiang](https://sg.linkedin.com/in/mui-tiang-sng), and too much to [Natalia Edzgveradze](https://ratings.fide.com/profile/13600788).

I'm thankful to Mr Enrique Pacencia and Mr Viktor Varavin who taught me Chess most patiently when I was a child.

My blogging style is inspired by [Jeremy Kun](https://jeremykun.com/) and my hero is Allyson Felix.
