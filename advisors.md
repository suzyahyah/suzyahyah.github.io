I was advised by [Chieu Hai Leong](https://chaileon.github.io) (DSO National Labs) and [Steve Renals](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/srenals/) (University of Edinburgh) and briefly by [Jiang Jing](http://w.mysmu.edu/faculty/jingjiang/). 

I'm also very lucky to work with [Kokil Jaidka](https://kokiljaidka.wordpress.com/about/) (National University of Singapore), Lambert Mathias (Facebook AI Integrity), and [Jason Eisner](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason) (JHU).

In my previous life I learnt some Human Factors and Social psychology from [Angela Tan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/angela-tan-aa67487/) and [Bernice Khoo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernicekhoo/?originalSubdomain=sg). I owe much to Dr. How Khee Yin, Chua Kuan Seah, Sng Mui Tiang, and too much to Natalia Edzgveradze.
