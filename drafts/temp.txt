**Natural base e and Softmax Function**
Why base e? "We prefer natural logs (logarithms with base e) because coefficients on the natural-log scale are directly interpretable as approximately proportional differences. With a coefficient of 0.06, a difference of 1 in x corresponds to an approximate 6% difference in y and so forth"

*Exponentials are also used in Probabilistic ML for the exponential family but we will not go into that here*.
