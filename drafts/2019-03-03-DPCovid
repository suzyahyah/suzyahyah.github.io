t’s been some weeks. Some people can deal with it easier than others. Maybe you’re one of the
people who can’t. Maybe you’re going through a hard time in your life right now, which makes
everything worse. I just want to tell you that It’s ok to feel unproductive, it’s ok to feel
lonely, its ok to be worried about your job, its ok to stress about that relationship. Do what
you can to cope, and seek help if you think you can’t. It’s going to get worse before it gets
better, and you are going to get better. 
This post is dedicated to you. And me. And Jet, who is doing one of the most critical things in
his life right now.
