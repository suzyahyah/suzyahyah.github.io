#### **Other Interests / Procrastinations**

* I played Chess when I was younger and was Singapore National Womens Champion in 2005. I revisited chess as an adult, during the deepest, longest and final wave of PhD-induced Depression. 

* The writing of Simone Weil very often floats into my head.

* I know 5 writing systems (Hangul, Han, Latin, Cyrilic, Japanese-has-3-but-we'll-count-it-as-one) even though I'm only bilingual English-Chinese.

* Very Amateur drummer.
