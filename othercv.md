#### **Other Interests / Procrastinations**

* I played Chess when I was younger and was Singapore National Womens Champion in 2005. Here's a [small contribution to the chess world]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link development_chess_theory.md %}). I revisited chess as an adult, during the biggest and last wave of PhD Depression. [You're welcome to Take a look.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Tej-o315uOPSX_d4_eL9adGrp3Nw02-Qplw4U42ehH4/edit?usp=sharing)

* The writing of Simone Weil very often floats into my head.

* I know 5 writing systems (Hangul, Han, Latin, Cyrilic, Japanese-has-3-but-we'll-count-it-as-one) even though I'm only bilingual English-Chinese.

* Very Amateur drummer. Here's a [small contribution to the drumming
