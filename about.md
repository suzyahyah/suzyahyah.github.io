My name is Suzanna Sia. 

I lead agentic LLM-RAG at Hyundai Motor Group Innovation Center (2023-) for Text, Diagrams, Tables and Source Code. I joined this industry because I believe LLMs will see their potential as an API layer to software, empowering our control of automation and robotics. And... I just like the [car](https://insideevs.com/news/674289/hyundai-ioniq-6-car-and-driver-ev-of-the-year/).

I graduated with a PhD in CS, Machine Larning and NLP, from Johns Hopkins (2018-2023) researching [Autoregressive LLM Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.03573.pdf), and previously worked on [explainability in Natural Language Inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.12469.pdf), [Topic Modeling](https://aclanthology.org/2021.eacl-main.209.pdf), [Clustering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.05525.pdf), [Computational Arguments](https://aclanthology.org/2022.emnlp-main.818.pdf), [Speaker Diarization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.13213.pdf) and [Conversational Systems](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3132847.3133185). I did two Covid internships at Facebook AI Integrity (Hate Speech). 

My nationality is Singaporean, and served a government bond at DSO National Labs from 2013-2018, first as a cognitive and social psychologist, and then as a NLP Engineer. Before that I joint majored in A.I and Psychology from the University of Edinburgh (2009-2013).
