I am a CS PhD student (2018-) focusing on NLP at Johns Hopkins. I currently do research in [Autoregressive LLM Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.03573.pdf), and previously worked on [explainability in Natural Language Inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.12469.pdf), [Topic Modeling](https://aclanthology.org/2021.eacl-main.209.pdf), [Clustering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.05525.pdf), [Computational Arguments](https://aclanthology.org/2022.emnlp-main.818.pdf), [Speaker Diarization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.13213.pdf) and [Conversational Systems](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3132847.3133185). 

I am Singaporean and was at DSO National Labs from 2013-2018, first as a cognitive and social psychologist, and then as a NLP Engineer. Before that I joint majored in A.I and Psychology from the University of Edinburgh.

This blog exists for me, but if another human were to benefit, that would be quite
fantastic!
