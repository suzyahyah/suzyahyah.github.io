I am a CS PhD student (2018-) focusing on NLP at Johns Hopkins. I seem to have settled on the research topic of autoregressive LLM Machine Translation. I am Singaporean and was at DSO National Labs from 2013-2018, first as a cognitive and social psychologist, and then as a NLP Engineer. Before that I joint majored in A.I and Psychology from the University of Edinburgh.

This blog exists for me, but if another human were to benefit, that would be quite
fantastic!
