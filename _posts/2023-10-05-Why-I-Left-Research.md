After 5 years as a PhD student, I'm taking a break from AI Research.

Research has a high proportion of incredibly smart self motivated people, and attracts even more
smart and self motivated people every year. The community certainly wouldn’t miss my headcount.
In fact I’ll risk offending a bunch of people and say the world of NLP research wouldn’t miss
a whole bunch of headcounts. 

I don't think it's too controversial to say the next model release can effectively render whatever "research" we did in between the previous model release and now irrelevant, and many papers at conferences (including my own) would become irrelevant at a blazingly fast pace. We can always find justifying scenarios, and disagree on how high the proportion of irrelevant papers are; my take - its too high.

Whereas in contrast, the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) is high enough that working on transitioning LLMs to real world use cases is *real*, it’s not the chatbot hype of 2014. Personally, I'm more of a wanderer rather than a specialist, and my background on psychology, human factors allows me to position for something broader. (Maybe if my background was Math and Physics I could be positioning for something more fundamental/specific.) Hyundai is no.3 in global automobile sales, has a real on the ground product with profit and loss, and I feel nervous (motivated) to justify my salary package in terms of actual value. 

While I won’t be contributing to it, I do regret losing sharpness by moving into strategy and
implementation. I’ll be working extra hard to reduce the decay. Go to conferences possibly out
of my own pocket, read one paper a month (optimistic), sneak into Jason’s reading group once in a while,
advise some junior students (contact me with your GitHub) or aim to submit one paper a year. 

I still enjoy research. But I’m strategically pivoting out of it when it’s the hottest and most
lucrative that it’s ever been.
