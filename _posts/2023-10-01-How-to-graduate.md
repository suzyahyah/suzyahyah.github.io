I had Cora-Ann in April 2023 and graduated in October 2023. I've been hesitant to write about it because I didn't want to play sympathies and seek attention with the baby+PhD card, or make anyone feel bad if they are in the same situation and still working towards graduating. 


However I'm starting to forget those anxiety-inducing days and brush it off as "it wasn't so bad" in my mind, which I hate to have happen because that's a reality distortion. Morning sickness was more like all day sickness for me, always nauseus, vomitting up to 4 times a day and even in the third trimester. Then there's child birth and recovery. Kelly reminds me that when she called several hours after Cora arrived, I had told her "Don't let anyone tell you it's ok because it's absolutely terrible, consciousness-losing pain". I couldn't sit for nearly 3 weeks and still have some residual condition that you don't want to hear about unless you're a doctor.

After taking the baby home, "nothing in your life has prepared you for that kind of fatigue", is a quote from my cousin that I've found to be true. The first night after the confinement nanny left, it was like the Battle of Helm's deep. Baby cried so much and as first time parents we didnt know how to debug, so we decided she had colic. (Which is basically baby cries excessively - dont know why). 

I was feeling most positive about "Sleep when the baby sleeps", but it's extremely well-intended advice which doesn't happen. All things considered, I think the number of effective working hours ranges from 0.5 to 2 hours a day. 2 hours is trying hard, and 3 hours would be a really amazing day. 

Anyway, I have to cut the rant off here, because this is a post about how I graduated. I do think that there was a fair bit of intentionality on shaping my circumstances, but ultimately I was extremely fortunate to have:

1. A supportive advisor. Kevin gave me two months maternity and did not place any additional pressure on me.

2. Help from my family and older friends. Went back to Singapore (best decision) and did the last 9 months of the PhD remotely. I am thankful for my friends in Baltimore but its a different phase of life. 

3. Improving mental health by outsourcing as much as possible. My life improved significantly after I stopped breastfeeding and could outsource night feeds. Talking in mum support groups treats the symptoms of post-partum depression - I managed to stay out of the groups.

4. Wrote the thesis and ran 6 projects off one code base. Invested time in tooling, continuous refactoring and code reusability. I don't dread looking at this codebase after 3 months.

5. Worked on analysis and empirical/experimental projects that I knew how to breakddown the tasks and execute. Not completely satisfied with my PhD because I had to give up working on some algorithmic projects, but I decided it was no longer feasible and it was more important to complete the program. 

Also did I mention Jet? Dude deserves his World's best dad and husband mug. Now that this post is
off my chest, the next post will be technical; I'm looking forward to it.
