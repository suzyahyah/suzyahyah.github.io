tldr: Tree LSTMs are an extension of traditional LSTMs designed for tree-structured network topologies. Unlike sequential models, which process words in temporal order, tree-structured models follow the given syntactic structure of a sentence, composing phrases based on this structure. The implementation of Tree LSTMs involves a parser to generate a parse tree, conversion of this tree into instructions for combining words, and the use of these instructions to progressively update RNN units.

#### Overview

*Tree LSTMs* generalise LSTMs to tree-structured network topologies. Compared to sequence
models which consider words as they appear in temporal order (or in the reverse direction),
tree-structured models compose each phrase from its subphrase according to the given syntatic
structure. 

Tree LSTMs are conceptually straightforward extension of RNN-LSTMs but need a fair bit of thought to implement. Here's what we need:

1. A parser (takes in a sentence and outputs the parse tree structure).
* Stanford Core NLP/your own parser

2. Given the parse tree structure which implicitly contains how the word units should be progressively combined, convert this into a *series of instructions* which explicitly describes how the words should be combined.

3. Write a RNN that takes in a series of instructions on how to combine a list of inputs. This
   strategy is inspired by stack LSTMs (Dyer et al., 2015) and Easy-first parsing(Kipperwasser and Goldberg, 2016). The key advantage of the latter
approach is that we can access any element of the 'stack' (therefore it is no longer a stack).

#### **1. Parser**
1. Download Stanford CoreNLP (2018 onwards) into your working directory. 
2. Write a script called `ParserDemo.java`, which reads in our text file and outputs the parses

{% highlight java %}
import edu.stanford.nlp.simple.*;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Paths;
import java.io.IOException;

public class ParserDemo {
  public static void main(String[] args){
    String text = "";
    try {
      text = new String(Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(args[0])));
    } catch (IOException e){
      e.printStackTrace();
    }
    
    String[] sentences = text.split("\n");
    for (String sent: sentences){
      Sentence s = new Sentence(sent);
      System.out.println(s.parse());
    }
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

A bash script to compile and run our Parser script.

{% highlight bash %}
cd stanford-corenlp-full-2018-10-05
javac -cp "*" ParserDemo.java
java -cp ":*" ParserDemo sents.txt > sents_parse.txt

{% endhighlight %}

Now, the sentence "Papa ate the caviar with a spoon" becomes

(ROOT (S (NP (NN Papa)) (VP (VBD ate) (NP (DT the) (NN caviar)) (PP (IN with) (NP (DT a) (NN
spoon)))) (. .))) "

We can visualise this with the nltk package
{% highlight python %}
from nltk.Tree import tree
from nltk.treetransforms import chomsky_normal_form as cnf
parse = Tree.fromstring(p)
#print(parse)
cnf(parse)
parse.pretty_print()

{% endhighlight %}

#### **2. Converting the parse tree into a series of instructions**

We build a Tree-LSTM from our understanding of how a standard RNN works. In contrast to the standard RNN which takes in the input from the previous time step, the tree-LSTM will take inputs from the hidden states of its child cell as described by the syntatic parse. 

This implementation is heavily influenced by stack-reduce-parsing. However unlike stack-reduce which processes things sequentially from the stack, our instructions allow us to combine the current representations at every position of the stack. 

We need to
* Maintain a stack with word and phrase representations to process
* Instructions on what to combine
* Update the stack accordingly

To extract the instructions, we rely on the nltk tree package. The cnf tree is encoded as a series of binary branching instructions, `0` indicates branch left and `1` indicates branch right. Based on the binary branching tree above, we can work out what each position refers to. 

Taking the leaves as example: 
* 'Papa': Left(0)-Left(0)-Left(0). 
* 'Caviar': Left(0)-Right(1)-Left(0)-Right(1)-Right(1)-Left(0). 

We can encode every tree position in this fashion.

{% highlight python %}
leaves = parse.treepositions('leaves')
# [(0,0,0), (0, 1, 0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0), (0, 1, 1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0)]
{% endhighlight %}

`treepositions` has parameters `postorder` and `preorder`, which corresponds to different types
of depth-first search. We use the pre-order search order for this implementation. 

The buffer is given by `tree.treepositions('postorder')`. For each element in the buffer, if it
is a leaf, add it to the stack to process. If not, get the stack-positions of all its children, and replace the children on the stack with the parent element. After processing each non-leaf buffer element, increment a sequence of actions. The action sequence can either be unary(single element) or binary(tuple), which informs us which stack positions should be progressively fed as input to the neural network starting from the leaves(words).  

{% highlight python %}
def get_action_sequence(parse):
  stack = []
  seq = []
  leaf_positions = parse.treepositions('leaves')

  buffer = parse.treepositions('postorder')
  
  for post in buffer:
    if postn in leaf_positions:
      stack.append(postn)
      continue

    child_pos = []
  
    for i, s in enumerate(stack):
      if s[:-1] == postn:
        child_pos.append(i)
    
    if len(child_pos)==1:
      stack[i] = postn
      seq.append(i)

    else:
      stack[child_pos[0]:(child_pos[1]+1)] = []
      stack.insert(child_pos[0], postn)
      seq.append(tuple(child_pos))
  
  return seq
#  [0, 1, 2, 3, (2, 3), (1, 2), 2, 3, 4, (3, 4), (2, 3), (1, 2), (0, 1), 0]
{% endhighlight %}

#### **3. Composing RNNs**
Unlike standard RNN modules hich take in a sequence, we have to progressively combine inputs as
specified by the action sequence, therefore all our RNN units are maintained at the cell level.
The architecture consists of
* two identical LSTM cells for combining the child nodes of the tree.
* a final layer
* initialisation layers for hidden and cell units of LSTM

While looping over the action sequence, we update our stack after each action with the new input, hidden cell, lstm cell: `(x, (hx, cx))`, noting that beyond the leaf nodes, `x` is simply a zero tensor because we only need to consider `hx` as inputs to the next cell.

We also need to maintain the stack with update and delete actions the same way we did
previously when getting instructions from the parse tree.

{% highlight python%}
class ChildTreeLSTM(nn.Module):
  
  def __init__(self, hidden_dim, device='cpu'):
      # pass
    super(ChildTreeLSTM, self).__init__()
    self.hdim = hidden_dim
    self.edim = 300
    self.lstm = nn.LSTMCell(self.edim, self.hdim)
    self.lstm2 = nn.LSTMCell(self.edim, self.hdim)

    self.final_layer = nn.Linear(self.hdim, 1) # map from hidden layer to output
    self.init_cx = nn.Parameter(torch.rand(1, self.hdim).cuda(device=device))
    self.zero_x = torch.zeros(1, self.edim, requires_grad=False).cuda(device=device)
    self.init_hx = torch.tanh(self.init_cx)

  def forward(self, sent, action_sequence):
        #initialize hx, cx
    stack = []
    hx = self.init_hx
    cx = self.init_cx

    for x in sent:
      x = self.embedding(x)
      x = x.view(1, x.shape[0])
      stack.append((x, (hx, cx)))

    for action in action_sequence:
      if type(action)==int:
        x, (hx, cx) = stack[action]
        
        # unirule lstm cell needs to take in x, hx, cx
        # after the first embedding has been read in, x is zero subsequently.
        hx, cx = self.lstm(x, (hx, cx))
        hx, cx = self.lstm2(x, (hx, cx))
        stack[action] = (self.zero_x, (hx, cx))

      if type(action)==tuple:
        x0, (hx0, cx0) = stack[action[0]]
        x1, (hx1, cx1) = stack[action[1]]
        # combine hx0 and hx1
        # combine x0 and x1
        hx = hx0 + hx1
        cx = cx0 + cx1

        hx, cx = self.lstm(self.zero_x, (hx, cx))
        hx, cx = self.lstm2(self.zero_x, (hx, cx))
        
        stack[action[0]] = (self.zero_x, (hx, cx))
        del stack[action[1]]

    assert len(stack)==1
    x, (hx, cx) = stack[0]
    score = self.final_layer(hx)

    return score

{% endhighlight %}

In this example we combine child cells by simply summing them together, but there are of course more
sophisticated ways of combining cells by doing clever things with the gating mechanism of the LSTM (Tai et
al., 2015).
